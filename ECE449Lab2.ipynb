        "In our lab, we gave the model 3 prompts. The first two prompts helped give the model the context it needed in order to make a decision. We used a multistep approach that made 2 API calls in order to make 1 decision. As mentioned in the description of Tree-of-Thought prompting, we need to give the model context based on each decision. This is why we used 2 steps. The first step is to get the current context of the maze, and the second is to advance our Depth-First Search algorithm to solve the maze. Prompt 1 focuses on giving the model the context for the entire maze, allowing the model to see where their current position is relative to the start and endpoint. This was useful for when the model needed to complete backtracking. Prompt 2 gives the model the current 3x3 neighbourhood that it is currently in, with the model at the centre. In this case, the prompt is important for the model to understand all of its current options. Prompt 3 gives the model the choice based on the last 2 prompts to choose a decision and a direction to advance the model through the searching algorithm."
